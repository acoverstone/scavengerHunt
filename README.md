Scavenger Hunt
=====================

## About This Project


This exciting app creates scavenger hunts for you and your friends. Set your location and a 
scavenger hunt key and you have a full scavenger hunt at your fingertips!  Give your friends
your key, have them join and then you're good to go!

This app is built using Ionic Framework for iOS and Android. Using the power of Clarifai,
you just take pictures of the items you are searching got and they are auto-magically marked off your list! First one to find all of the items wins!

<!-- We recommend using the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli) to create new Ionic projects that are based on this project but use a ready-made starter template.

For example, to start a new Ionic project with the default tabs interface, make sure the `ionic` utility is installed:

```bash
$ npm install -g ionic
```

Then run: 

```bash
$ ionic start myProject tabs
```

More info on this can be found on the Ionic [Getting Started](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started) page and the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli) repo.
